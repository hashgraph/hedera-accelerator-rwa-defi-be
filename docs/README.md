## 🎯 Overview

The Hedera RWA DeFi Accelerator is a comprehensive suite of smart contracts designed to tokenize real-world assets (buildings) and provide DeFi functionality on the Hedera EVM. The project enables:

-   **Tokenized Real Estate**: Buildings represented as ERC3643-compliant security tokens
-   **Yield Generation**: Automated compounding and reward distribution
-   **Governance**: On-chain voting and decision making
-   **Compliance**: Built-in KYC/AML and regulatory compliance
-   **Portfolio Management**: Automated rebalancing and asset allocation

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following key principles:

-   **Factory Pattern**: All major components use factory contracts for deployment
-   **Upgradeable Contracts**: Beacon proxy pattern for long-term maintainability
-   **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for different actors
-   **Composability**: Components can be combined to create complex DeFi products

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js 18+
-   Yarn package manager
-   Hardhat development environment
-   Hedera testnet/mainnet access

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-accelerator-defi-eip.git
cd hedera-accelerator-defi-eip

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Compile contracts
yarn compile
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
RPC_URL=https://testnet.hashio.io/api
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Quick Deployment

```bash
# Deploy all contracts to testnet
yarn deploy

# Deploy specific components
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy-building.ts --network testnet
```

### Step-by-Step Deployment

1. **Deploy Core Infrastructure**

    ```bash
    yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network testnet
    ```

2. **Deploy Building Suite**

    ```bash
    yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy-building.ts --network testnet
    ```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run all test suites
yarn test

# Run specific test file
yarn hardhat test test/buildings/building.test.ts

# Run with gas reporting
yarn test --gas-report
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage report
yarn hardhat coverage
```

### Test Structure

-   **Unit Tests**: Individual contract functionality
-   **Integration Tests**: Cross-contract interactions

## 📁 Data Folder

The `data/` folder contains important deployment and configuration information:

### Structure

```
data/
├── abis/           # Contract ABIs for all deployed contracts
├── deployments/    # Deployment addresses by network
└── chain-296.json  # Hedera testnet deployment addresses
```

### Usage

-   **ABIs**: Used for frontend integration and contract interactions
-   **Deployments**: Contains all deployed contract addresses for each network
-   **Chain Configs**: Network-specific deployment information

### Accessing Deployment Data

```typescript
import deployments from "../data/deployments/chain-296.json";

// Get building factory address
const buildingFactory = deployments.factories.BuildingFactory;

// Get implementation addresses
const tokenImpl = deployments.implementations.Token;
```
