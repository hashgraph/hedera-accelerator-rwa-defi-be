# Buildings Module

The Buildings module is the core component of the Hedera RWA DeFi Accelerator, providing a complete suite for tokenizing real-world real estate assets. Each building deployment creates a comprehensive ecosystem of interconnected smart contracts.

## üìã Overview

The Buildings module implements a factory-based pattern to deploy modular, governable, and compliant tokenized buildings. Each deployed building bundle includes:

-   **ERC3643 Token**: Security token representing building ownership
-   **ERC4626 Vault**: Asset management and yield generation
-   **Governor Contract**: On-chain governance and decision making
-   **Treasury Contract**: Fund management and distribution
-   **Identity System**: KYC/AML compliance using OnchainID
-   **Auto Compounder**: Automated yield optimization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Factory Pattern

The `BuildingFactory` contract orchestrates the deployment of all building components:

```solidity
contract BuildingFactory is AccessControl, BuildingFactoryStorage {
    function newBuilding(
        NewBuildingDetails calldata details
    ) external returns (address buildingAddress)
}
```

### Component Integration

Each building deployment creates a complete ecosystem:

```
BuildingFactory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BuildingToken (ERC3643)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BuildingVault (ERC4626)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BuildingGovernor
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BuildingTreasury
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BuildingAutoCompounder
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Identity Contracts (OnchainID)
```

## üîß Core Components

### BuildingToken (ERC3643)

```solidity
contract BuildingToken is ERC3643 {
    // Compliance features
    - KYC/AML verification

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### 1. Configuration Setup

```typescript
const buildingDetails = {
    tokenURI: "https://example.com/downtown-office-metadata",
    tokenName: "Downtown Office Building",
    tokenSymbol: "DOB",
    tokenDecimals: 18,
    tokenMintAmount: ethers.parseEther("1000000"),
    treasuryReserveAmount: ethers.parseUnits("10000", 6),
    treasuryNPercent: 2000, // 20% to business
    governanceName: "Downtown Office Governance",
    vaultShareTokenName: "Downtown Office Vault Share",
    vaultShareTokenSymbol: "DOVS",
    vaultFeeReceiver: feeReceiverAddress,
    vaultFeeToken: usdcAddress,
    vaultFeePercentage: 100, // 1%
    vaultCliff: 0,
    vaultUnlockDuration: 86400 * 30, // 30 days
    aTokenName: "Downtown Office Auto Compounder",
    aTokenSymbol: "DOAC",
};
```

### 2. Factory Deployment

```typescript
// Deploy building via factory
const buildingFactory = await ethers.getContractAt("BuildingFactory", factoryAddress);

const buildingDetails = {
    tokenURI: "https://example.com/building-metadata",
    tokenName: "Building Token",
    tokenSymbol: "BT",
    tokenDecimals: 18,
    tokenMintAmount: ethers.parseEther("1000000"),
    treasuryReserveAmount: ethers.parseUnits("10000", 6),
    treasuryNPercent: 2000, // 20%
    governanceName: "Building Governance",
    vaultShareTokenName: "Building Vault Share",
    vaultShareTokenSymbol: "BVS",
    vaultFeeReceiver: feeReceiverAddress,
    vaultFeeToken: usdcAddress,
    vaultFeePercentage: 100, // 1%
    vaultCliff: 0,
    vaultUnlockDuration: 86400 * 30, // 30 days
    aTokenName: "Building Auto Compounder",
    aTokenSymbol: "BAC",
};

const tx = await buildingFactory.newBuilding(buildingDetails);

const receipt = await tx.wait();
const buildingAddress = receipt.logs[0].args.building;
```

### 3. Component Access

```typescript
// Get all building component addresses
const buildingDetails = await buildingFactory.getBuildingDetails(buildingAddress);

// Access individual components
const buildingToken = buildingDetails.erc3643Token;
const buildingVault = buildingDetails.vault;
const buildingGovernor = buildingDetails.governance;
const buildingTreasury = buildingDetails.treasury;
const buildingAutoCompounder = buildingDetails.autoCompounder;
const auditRegistry = buildingDetails.auditRegistry;
const nftId = buildingDetails.nftId;
```

## üîê Identity and Compliance

### OnchainID Integration

Each building deployment creates identity contracts:

```typescript
// Identity contracts created
const identity = await buildingFactory.getBuildingIdentity(buildingAddress);
const claimIssuer = await buildingFactory.getBuildingClaimIssuer(buildingAddress);
```

### Compliance Modules

Configurable compliance modules:

-   **Country Allow Module**: Restrict transfers by country
-   **Max Ownership Module**: Limit individual ownership
-   **Transfer Limit Module**: Restrict transfer amounts
-   **NFT Module**: Require NFT ownership for transfers

### KYC/AML Process

1. **Identity Creation**: User creates OnchainID
2. **Claim Issuance**: KYC provider issues claims
3. **Token Transfer**: Only verified users can receive tokens
4. **Ongoing Compliance**: Continuous verification

## üèõÔ∏è Governance System

### Proposal Creation

```typescript
// Create governance proposal
const governor = await ethers.getContractAt("BuildingGovernor", buildingGovernorAddress);

const proposalTx = await governor.propose(
    [treasuryAddress], // targets
    [0], // values
    [calldata], // calldata
    "Proposal Description",
);
```

### Voting Process

```typescript
// Cast vote
await governor.castVote(proposalId, 1); // 1 = For, 0 = Against, 2 = Abstain

// Execute proposal
await governor.execute(proposalId);
```

### Governance Parameters

-   **Voting Delay**: Time before voting starts
-   **Voting Period**: Duration of voting
-   **Proposal Threshold**: Minimum tokens to create proposal
-   **Quorum**: Minimum participation required

## üí∞ Treasury Management

### Fund Collection

```typescript
// Deposit USDC to treasury
const treasury = await ethers.getContractAt("BuildingTreasury", treasuryAddress);

await treasury.deposit(ethers.parseUnits("10000", 6)); // 10,000 USDC
```

### Payment Processing

```typescript
// Make payment (governance only)
await treasury.makePayment(recipientAddress, ethers.parseUnits("5000", 6));
```

### Reserve Management

```typescript
// Update reserve amount
await treasury.setReserveAmount(ethers.parseUnits("15000", 6));
```

## üîÑ Auto Compounding

### Deposit to Auto Compounder

```typescript
// Deposit underlying assets
const autoCompounder = await ethers.getContractAt("BuildingAutoCompounder", autoCompounderAddress);

await autoCompounder.deposit(ethers.parseEther("1000"), userAddress);
```

### Reward Management

```typescript
// Check exchange rate
const exchangeRate = await autoCompounder.exchangeRate();

// Claim user rewards
await autoCompounder.claimExactUserReward(userAddress);

// Trigger compounding
await autoCompounder.claim();
```

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics

-   **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: Total assets in vault
-   **Token Supply**: Circulating token supply
-   **Governance Participation**: Voting activity
-   **Treasury Balance**: Available funds
-   **Compounding Performance**: Exchange rate growth

### Events to Monitor

```solidity
// Building deployment
event BuildingDeployed(address indexed building, address indexed token, address indexed vault);

// Governance events
event ProposalCreated(uint256 indexed proposalId, address indexed proposer);
event VoteCast(address indexed voter, uint256 indexed proposalId, uint8 support);

// Treasury events
event Deposit(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
event Payment(address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);

// Auto compounding events
event Deposit(address indexed sender, address indexed receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 shares);
event Claim(uint256 underlyingAmount);
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Access Control

-   **Factory Role**: Only authorized addresses can deploy buildings
-   **Governance Role**: Token holders control building decisions
-   **Treasury Role**: Restricted payment capabilities
-   **Admin Role**: Initial setup and emergency functions

### Upgradeability

-   **Beacon Proxies**: All components use upgradeable patterns
-   **Implementation Authority**: Centralized upgrade control
-   **Governance Control**: Community-controlled upgrades

### Compliance

-   **Identity Verification**: All token holders must be verified
-   **Transfer Restrictions**: Configurable compliance rules
-   **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history
-   **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in KYC/AML
